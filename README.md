# Image-Searching
In this project I am implementing a template matching algorithm. 

Using this project we can find the coordinate of a reference image in a test image if the reference image exists in the test image.

I am using Python as the programming language.

This project is done as a requirement of my undergrad course CSE 474 - Pattern Recognition Sessional.
